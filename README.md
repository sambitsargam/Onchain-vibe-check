# 🧬 Onchain Vibe Check

Turn your onchain and Farcaster activity into a beautifully animated, shareable identity card. This Mini App analyzes your social graph, wallet data, and casting style to assign you a "vibe type" — and lets you mint it as an NFT.

---

## 🔥 Project Overview

**Goal**: Help users express their Web3 personality through a beautifully designed, dynamic card based on their social + wallet behavior.

**User Flow**:
1. Connect Farcaster identity & wallet
2. Analyze activity & generate a "Vibe Type"
3. Render an animated card preview
4. Optionally mint the card as an NFT
5. Share it in a cast and compare vibes

**Personality Types** *(examples)*:
- **The Meme Oracle** – high emoji, chaotic energy
- **The Builder** – technical casts, repo links
- **The Maximalist** – ETH-aligned, minimal social
- **The Degenerate** – NFT flipper, token hoarder

**Possible Badges**:
- OG – early user
- DAO-lover – part of many communities
- Whale – big wallet energy
- Anon – no ENS, no cast

**Unique Touches**:
- Dynamic card animations based on personality
- Use of OpenAI to analyze tone or cast frequency
- Seasonal updates to vibes (like Spotify Wrapped)

# 🧬 Onchain Vibe Check

Turn your onchain and Farcaster activity into a beautifully animated, shareable identity card. This Mini App analyzes your social graph, wallet data, and casting style to assign you a "vibe type" — and lets you mint it as an NFT **on Base**.

---

## 🔥 Project Overview

**Goal**: Help users express their Web3 personality through a beautifully designed, dynamic card based on their social + wallet behavior.

**Built on**: [Base](https://base.org) – fast, low-cost Ethereum L2 to make minting smooth and scalable.

**User Flow**:
1. Connect Farcaster identity & wallet  
2. Analyze activity & generate a "Vibe Type"  
3. Render an animated card preview  
4. Optionally mint the card as an NFT **on Base**  
5. Share it in a cast and compare vibes  

**Personality Types** *(examples)*:
- **The Meme Oracle** – high emoji, chaotic energy  
- **The Builder** – technical casts, repo links  
- **The Maximalist** – ETH-aligned, minimal social  
- **The Degenerate** – NFT flipper, token hoarder  

**Possible Badges**:
- OG – early user  
- DAO-lover – part of many communities  
- Whale – big wallet energy  
- Anon – no ENS, no cast  

**Unique Touches**:
- Dynamic card animations based on personality  
- Use of OpenAI to analyze tone or cast frequency  
- Seasonal updates to vibes (like Spotify Wrapped)  
- **Optimized for the Base chain** for low-gas minting
